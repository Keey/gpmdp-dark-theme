# gpmdp-dark-theme

Spotify-like theme for Google Play Music Desktop Player. This is for testing and work in progress, because I don't use GPMDP as my main GM player (using radiant-player-mac).

### Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to settings, select Custom theme > Light
3. Choose black.css as your custom theme
